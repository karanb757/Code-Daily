//1. Var let const ->
// var   -> var are variables to store data wheter alphabets numbers boolean that can be changed !!
var a="hello"
console.log(a);
// let   -> let keyword is improved version of var keyword introduced in (ES6). A variable declared in a block with let is only available for use within that block it cant be redeclared out of scope()
let pageNum=10;
console.log(page)
// const -> const are constants that cant be changed once declared !!
const c=102;
console.log(c);
// c=103 //NOT POSSIBLE !!

//2. Hoisting ->
// Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where function declarations and variable declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
// This means that functions() and variables can be used before they are declared.
// Here is an example of hoisting:

console.log(b); //undefined
var b= 120;

//3. Data types in JS ->
//Primitive     -> Num Var String Bool Null Undefined Symbol BigInt
//Non-Primitive -> object Array 

//4. Conditionals
//if 
//else if
//else 

//5. Loops
//A.for 
//B.While 

//6.Functions()

//7.parameters & arguments

//8.Array

// 1:11:23 Objects
